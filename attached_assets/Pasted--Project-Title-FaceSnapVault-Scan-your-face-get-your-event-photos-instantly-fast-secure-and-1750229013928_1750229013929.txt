📸 Project Title: FaceSnapVault
“Scan your face, get your event photos instantly — fast, secure, and accurate with Google Cloud Vision.”

🎯 Core Goal
Build a smart photo retrieval web app that:

Uses Google Cloud Vision API to detect faces.

Stores face vectorsit

Minimizes face match API calls by doing offline face comparison using local vector storage.

Uses Firebasefor aut

Sends matched photos via email and allows viewing in the user dashboard.

💡 Key Features
1. 🔐 Login / Signup System
Firebase

Store use

Role

2. 🧑‍💻 User Flow
User logs in and uploads a selfie and enters the this.

Backend loads all face embeddings of that event from local DB.

Mother

Displays them in their dashboard.

3. 📸 Photographer / Admin Upload
Upload photo → Detect all faces using Google Cloud Vision API (one-time only)

Store:

Face vector for each face

Photo ID + URL

Face bou

Save face vectors in a local vector DB or JSON/SQLitefile for

4. 🧠 Fac
Use Google Vision only for initial face vector extraction

Store vectors as .npy or pickle or JSON files

When selfie is uploaded:

With

Compare with local vectors using cosine similarity

No repeated Google API calls = fast + cost-efficient

5. 📂 User Profile
Stores:

List of matched photos

History of scanned selfies

Re-download or re-match for past events

Can delete account or photos

6. 🛠️ Admin Panel

🚀 Optimize
🧠 Cache a using Redis or Python dicts.

💾 Store user selfie vectors and avoid duplicate uploads (hashed comparison).

🔍 Only compare against faces from selected event.

📉 Pre-compute and store cosine similarity if needed for batch jobs.

🔐 Privacy & Data Security
Selfies and embeddings are not reused.

Only embeddings are stored (not raw face images).

Option to let users delete face data.

All data encrypted at rest (Firebase or PostgreSQL).
